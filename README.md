# Management-Strategy-Simulation-Model
I built a Monte Carlo simulation model to evaluate multiple candidate management strategies for a fish species in the Gulf of Mexico. 
The model represents all major components of the fish population, fishery, and management dynamics for a high profile sportfish in my region.

Figure 1: Key components and associated interactions representing in simulation.


I evaluated alternate and control scenarios for key model inputs, including hatchery input (number of hatchery-raised fish released 
into the wild), discard mortality (fish that die due to catch-and-release angling), and SPR (a reference point used by policy-makers).

Figure 2: Alternate and control scenarios evaluated using the simulation model. 

Results indicated that hatchery programs would need to stock more than one million fish annually to increase
harvest by 10% with a high probability. Reductions in discard mortality (9% DM, 8% DM, 5% DM) had a low probability 
of increasing harvest by 10%.

Figure 3: Proportional change in harvest for hatchery input from one to five million individuals, and reductions in discard mortality
(DM) from one to five percent. 

One takeaway is that hatchery programs need to release millions of individuals at minimum to have the intended impact on the fishery.
This readme is a very brief and targeted explanation of a multifaceted project.
